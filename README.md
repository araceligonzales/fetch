```
As a pet owner, I want to connect my pets to other pets

I want to create a profile using Fetch for my dog so he/she can have a playmate and we can explore nearby areas.

Before I want to log in, As a user, I need to create a profile.

When I log in, I can see my dogs profile as well as their matches and the settings of my profile.
